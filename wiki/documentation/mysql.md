# ðŸ“Š MySQL

In this project, MySQL was chosen as the database management system. MySQL is a widely-used open-source relational database that offers scalability, reliability, and robust performance. It is well-suited for handling large volumes of data and is compatible with various development frameworks and programming languages.

MySQL provides a rich set of features, including support for transactions, stored procedures, triggers, and views, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from small-scale projects to enterprise-level systems.

To integrate MySQL into the project, appropriate drivers and connectors were utilized to establish a connection between the application and the database server. Additionally, ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) frameworks such as Entity Framework Core were utilized to simplify database interactions and streamline development processes.

By leveraging MySQL, the project benefits from a stable and efficient database solution that meets its requirements for data storage, retrieval, and management.
